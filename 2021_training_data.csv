Service Request,GEL-137735,179468,,Issue with rare_disease_interpreted table?,29/Dec/21 1:44 PM,rbevers,Internal User,"Hi Roel,

 

I was having a look at the rare_disease_interpreted table and realised that, whilst for genomes on assembly GRCh37 there are several where the biological_relationship_to_proband column is filled in (with Father, Daughter, Mother etc), when I pick assembly GRCh38 this column is always blank. Is this expected?  I looked specifically at an example, 111000024, and I can see the four members in the Platypus VCF in it, as well as the genomes of the other family members (111000025-27) in the rare_disease_analysis table. Shouldn’t these also be in the rare_disease_interepreted table?

 

I might be confused about the logic of the table but otherwise I think that there is a bug somewhere there.

 

Cheers,

Loukas"

Service Request,GEL-137098,178783,,Note regarding GoAnywhere (software used for Airlock) and Log4shell,20/Dec/21 4:51 PM,podonovan1,Internal User,"Hello,

I have copied in below an email I received over the weekend regarding GoAnywhere and the Log4shell vulnerability and steps to take to mitigate the risk from it. Others working on this issue have likely already also received this email so this ticket may well be redundant, but I thought I should make it just in case others have not received the email. 

 

Basically the jist of the mitigation steps link is that we need to install a new patch to the software to further mitigate the risk. Now, we were already planning to upgrade the software to the latest version as part of the migration to AWS, so hopefully this can just be wrapped up into being part of that work. The full text of the email is below:

Incident,GEL-135930,177301,,GEL RE - cannot log out ,09/Dec/21 12:42 PM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"Hi, 

I have several with my GEL RE and particularly R studio. It started with issues in R studio, such as saving some of the scripts - the error I was getting is 'invalid argument'. I tried to restart the R studio, but it got stuck on the initialising stage. I logged out and when I logged in, the R studio does allow me to open any script saying 'No such file or directory'. Currently, when I try to log out, I get an error saying: Session manager must be in idle state when requesting shut down'. I think resetting my session could help, as I have had similar issues before - do you know what might be causing it and how to prevent it from hapenning again? 

Thank you,

Would it be possible to integrate statistics software within the RE? I have been using GraphPad prism in the past - would it be possible to integrate this?

Otherwise, Sigmaplot and SPSS or STATA are stats packages and would also be a good alternative. They are usually free within academic institutions. So far, there is only R - which requires coding (but I am a clinician and can't code).

Dear GEL team, 

  

I am using the aggV2 dataset for the AVT workflow and was wondering whether additional functional annotations could be added to aggV2 so that I can include these annotations for variant filtering within the AVT workflow. 

  

I am interested in CADD v1.6 annotations (I believe that currently only CADD v1.5 is currently included). I do not plan on using Revel but it is an in silico tool commonly used in clinical practice so it may be useful for others if this is added concurrently. 

  

Many thanks,

I have 2 questions about the 'tiering_data' grid in Labkey. 

Firstly, if a variant is listed as 'CompoundHeterozygous' segregation pattern, does this guarantee that there will be a second variant in the same participant in the same gene i.e. true compound heterozygous? I've noticed several variants listed as 'CompoundHeterozygous' with no other variants in the same gene.

Secondly, I've noticed the same variant listed multiple times in the same participant, but with different phenotypes. I'm assuming this is to show multiple phenotypes in the same participant, but does this hold true for the whole data grid?

Incident,GEL-133577,174848,,R script problems on helix,24/Nov/21 10:34 AM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"Hi,

I am trying to run a R job as a submitted job on helix. The R script works fine when I run it locally in Rstudio, but one of the steps of the script are computationally intensive therefore I would like to submit it as a job. When I submit the job the first 2 steps of the script run fine (it creates and saves input files), but the third step runs without ever finishing (started last night, still running now). The same step however when run in Rstudio only takes about 2 minutes. I've tried different job submission setting and so on but I cannot seem to find the problem. I've attached a screenshot of my script and the job submission script below.  The critical step is step 3 (on screenshot 3) where I run the nmf function. The job should not need as many resources as requested but I thought that maybe this is the issue, but it doesn't seem like it. 

I wonder whether this has something to do with R in helix having different configurations than R studio in the research environment?

I'd be grateful for any help or suggestions.

Dear Genomic England service team, 

  

Good afternoon, sorry for writing this email to bother you, I am Dong Sun, currently studying PhD in the University of Leeds and I am doing a research project inside GEL environment.  

  

I am writing this email because I am trying to get some deNovo data for the patient that I am interested in (not covered by the current de novo pipeline) and I want to use Platypus variant caller to do that. However, I am struggling with the usage of Platypus software in HPC in GEL, so I am wondering if you may help me on this issue.  I tried to load the module of platypus in HPC. However, it showed as “Platypus command not found”; and I also tried to install the python package of Platypus through conda environment, and after I import the package, I tried to load the help(Platypus) to see the documentation it for the usage, but only limited description of the package is showing. I am really struggling on this issue now, and I would be very appreciated if I may have a chance to get your help. 

  

Also thanksss so much for your patience of reading my email. 

  

Hope you have a great day~ 

  

Sincerely yours, 

Dong

Incident,GEL-132811,174007,,Long queue on helix,18/Nov/21 11:10 AM,rbevers,GeCIP User,"Dear Helpdesk,

I am having difficulty getting my jobs submitted via LSF to complete on Helix.

These jobs are submitted initially as medium jobs via an interactive nextflow pipeline. Some of the jobs exceed the medium queue running time (hence why they have to be long – and cannot be split into smaller chunks). Each job takes 24-72 hours to complete. I submitted these on 16/10/21 and as the HPC was reset on 30/10/21 I had to resubmit them on 2/11/21 and 3/11/21. 

The number of my jobs running at any one time varies from 0-10 (they also are spontaneously suspended my LSF).

At this current rate I would anticipate it would take months for my jobs to complete - which places a significant barrier to achieving the aims of the research project.

Looking at the fair share statistics, my CPU running time is low compared to others - (13 other users use more CPU time and appear to have more short, medium and long jobs running compared to me). 

Can you please help?

I'm trying to work out why I'm finding discrepancies between some of the glioma data bases.

The molecular_mutations_in_path_reports, in the glioma dataset pilot subset, list mutations which are not found in the reported variants csvs (for the patients matched by patient ID). Why might this be the case?

Would you like me to send some example patient IDs?

Service Request,GEL-132372,173545,,Advice on code compiler / text editor,16/Nov/21 10:21 AM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"I am looking for advice on the best way to compile my code and to send it to the terminal. At the moment I am compiling my bash code in text editor and then copy and pasting it to the terminal, which is quite time consuming. On my local machine I use Sublime text editor, which has a plugin that allows me to send text to the terminal window with keyboard shortcuts. I wonder if such a compiler/text editor is already available in the Research Environment or whether I will need to setup something up myself?

around it seems eagle2 is the best method of doing this.

Before embarking on a new bioinformatics odyssey I wanted to see if
there were plans/code that your team have used already for phasing or if
phasing was in the works at all within GEL centrally?

Looking at the Eagle2 pages I would need to generate a genetic map of a
reference panel, probably 1000 genomes, on build38 as there doesn't seem
to be one quickly available.

Many thanks

Incident,GEL-130881,171941,,Large memory and HPC requirement,04/Nov/21 11:57 AM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,I would be grateful for advice. I plan to apply an algorithm (GenePy) to all known genes. I intend to use the aggregated gvcf chunks for this. This involves  running a pipeline which applies basic QC and then annotates using ANNOVAR for gnomAD alelle frequencies and refseq gene information and CADD 1.6 before running the GenePy algorithm.

Hi Matthieu, 

  

Thanks again for reminding me of the steps to retrieving participant’s hospital records. 

  

There is an error message and I would be thankful if you could further review the codes ? I’ve screen-shot below and hopefully it’s helpful. If not, I’ve saved it “Evelyn_example”. 

  

Many thanks and hope to hear from you.

{color:#333333}Summary : hes_apc data and excel sheet
 Updated Comment : Dear Evelyn,{color} 

{color:#333333}Many thanks for this question and the other question that you sent in last week.{color} 

{color:#333333}To address the specific concern regarding the HES_APC table that you have, the table that is visible in the LabKey app will be one page of over 11800 pages of table data, the export function in LabKey will not be able to provide you with a comprehensive single spreadsheet for the whole labkey HES_APC table. This will be the case for most tables in LabKey.{color} 

{color:#333333}To respond to the question that you asked in your ticket{color} [GEL-130256|https://jiraservicedesk.extge.co.uk/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/GEL-130256]{color:#333333}, the HES_APC table also has 459 columns, which cannot all fit on the single view of the LabKey application, you would need to horizontally scroll through the table to locate the collumns of interest.{color} 

{color:#333333}I hope that the dimensions of the table described above will I hope this information proves helpful, you in understanding why we recommend a more computational approach to access the data in these tables.{color} 

{color:#333333}Kind regards,{color}

Service Request,GEL-129680,170309,,Biomart Whitelisting Conflict,25/Oct/21 3:18 PM,rbevers,Internal User,"Hi team,

Wanted to make a separate ticket for this as I think it needs to be looked at in detail and is currently blocking the resolution of a ticket.

Within the RE ensembl.org is whitelisted, and their corresponding mirrors (USwest, USeast, Asia). The biomaRt package requests data via these URLs and it seems like this is technically functioning correctly.

However, I tried to manually download data from Ensembl (via their Biomart partner). See the following steps.

 

*screen01*: Visual prior to picking a database, and starting screen. 

*screen02*: Clicking on pulldown menu, and choosing the ensembl genes 104. Clicked to confirm.

*screen03*: Choose Dataset becomes available after screen02. Clicked on the pulldown menu again, and selecting ""Human genes (GRCh38.p13)"".

*screen04*: This screen appears immediately after selecting ""Human genes (GRCh38.p13)"".

 

I am not quite sure why it allows me to make the first request (ensembl genes 104) but not the Human genes selection later on as it's both sending information to their server. That's probably less important however in a contextual sense as we would require this to be accessible. This allows users to directly download relevant gene information of their interest without our involvement. This is a relatively basic function/necessity, and was available before the Whitelisting rework. 

 

If you want to have a look at how it looks outside the RE1, click on the following link:

[http://www.ensembl.org/index.html] (or [http://useast.ensembl.org/index.html]), and click on BioMart in the top bar. This should take you to the following page (or equiv due to session dependency): [http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/a3ebcce35ec4c50e183710deed096cfa]. When you then select the options above (may take some time to load), you'll get to *screenshot screen05_outsideRE1*.

 

We should discuss a way around the issue, because I think this should be allowed from within  RE1.

Thanks,

Roel"

I was wondering if you may be able to help. I am trying to use the GeneVariantWorkflow found at :

I have copied it to my GeCIP area:

/re_gecip/hearing and sight/NOwen/scripts/gwv-1.7/

and edited the gene_list.txt as needed, I also edited the variant_workflow_inputs.json to reflect release 13 and the latest Clinvar release on the RE. In the variant_workflow_options.json I also added polyphen b as detailed.

Finally I edited the submit_workflow.sh to reflect the queue and project code, and cwd of the workflow

Its submits ok, but the errors:

sed -i ""/^http_proxy/d"" .Renviron

The script basically loads a dataframe with a column called ‘gene’.
Then I do the tabulation of that column calling this new dataframe ‘genes’
Then I query the hsapiens ensemble database.

I’ve tried to fix it in different ways for example using unlist for the values or generating a variable try<-unlist(genes$Var1) as in the previous screenshot (which is a character)

I’ve also tried doing as suggested here: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/121331/

Research Enquiries,GEL-126730,166570,,Clarification of airlock rules,01/Oct/21 10:07 AM,podonovan1,Other,"Hello,
Before I submit a file to export via the airlock, I'd like a tiny but of clarification, because I've not exported similar data before.
I want to produce a table of the number of people carrying different mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene. The most common mutations are carried by hundreds of people, down to rarer mutations carried by one or two people. How detailed can I get with the rarer mutations.
Ideally I'd like a table of SNP id and sample number that starts:
SNP1 201
SNP2 94
SNP3 23
 and ends:
SNP32 3
SNP33 1
SNP34 1

Am I allowed to get to the end of the table, or do I have to get to SNPs with 5 patients, than a line saying the next X SNPs had 4 patients, Y SNPs had 3 etc. See the attached screenshot of a similar table from a recent paper.

I hope that makes sense. It's easier to get clarification in advance that accidentally break the rules.

This incident ticket is for system administrators / Platform engineers, possibly in the RE1 squad.

 

Very recently, the file permissions of a subset of the aggV2 dataset on Weka have been changed in an unexpected way, resulting in that part of the dataset being hidden from users of the Research Environment (RE1).

Can that change please be reverted asap, as this issue means that external users and customers cannot use aggV2 for research?

 

The change affected this folder and all of the files it contains:

/gel_data_resources/main_programme/aggregation/aggregate_gVCF_strelka/aggV2/functional_annotation/VEP_99

 

Can that folder, and all of its content, be made visible to all users again please?

Also, as a secondary point, the files contained in the folder should not be ""executable"" - so can this be reverted too please?

I tried to log out and back in and even cleaned my internet cache but I can no longer even login to the RE. Could you please check if there is a problem with my profile.
It may be of use to know that when I did login earlier and tried to open LO it said that the files I wanted to open were already open somewhere else and that I should shut them down in the other location but I don't know if it's possible to do that?
I'd really appreciate it if you could look into this as I was in the middle of long, on going analysis of the data.

Incident,GEL-125583,165103,,Ticket for investigation of why I can no longer access Airlock admin websites,21/Sep/21 4:59 PM,parunachalam1,Internal User,"Hi, 

Currently when I try to access the Airlock admin websites in the RE, the request times out. I initially thought this would be a temporary issue that would resolve itself, but it has now been going on for a few days (I believe since the RE migration). I then thought that perhaps the websites were no longer whitelisted, but from talking to Kanmi Durotoye he can still access the websites. Therefore, I now believe that this is an issue with my account (possibly linked to the migration in some way). 

Can this please be looked into? Not being able to access these 2 admin websites is a major hindrance to my work on the Airlock: for example, for the ticket GEL-125130 I can't take the next step suggested by Pro2col, the software support providers, because I can't access these admin websites.

This is occurring withing the first stage of the workflow and the stderr referred to has the same few bytes of information. I have tried switching out the pheno file for a different larger one (from 21 vs 450 case/control to 300 vs 20000) but this hasn’t changed things. I suspect it is something really basic but can’t quite figure it out. I am running a group_file of 59 variants in total.

Dear Genomics England team,

 

Hello, this is Shohei. I am a bioinformatician of Astellas Pharma Inc.

I have an issue regarding a connection to the reserved compute node, Pegasus.

 

Migration of Genomics England Research Environment to AWS was done yesterday.

After the migration, I cannot connect to Pegasus.

First I thought it was a server maintenance issue, but I can connect to Helix without any problems.

 

I remembered that our initial contract of Pegasus usage was supposed to be end by 9/17 though we extended it for 2 month.

Therefore, I suspect that the permission to connect to the Pegasus has expired as originally planned.

 

So, we would appreciate it if you could confirm the status of Pegasus and the permissions to connect to Pegasus.

 

Yours sincerely,

Shohei

Are there any general problems with the RE after the AWS migration?
  


  

I don't seem to be able to log into the RE at the moment.
  

It worked earlier on in the day for me but I could not open many of the applications: Rstudio (either through the desktop icon or through the terminal), LibreOffice and Excel and I couldn't access older scripts of mine saved in my personal folder in the shared_GeCIP directory.
  


  

Many thanks in advance.

I am emailing to ask about the process of publishing analysis completed in the GE server. I want to complete HLA-typing and neo-epitope analysis in cutaneous SCC and need to be quick due to multiple additional labs looking at this cancer type. 

  

What is the process from completing analysis to writing a paper? Are there certain permissions on what can be exported and used for publication? What should the materials and methods look like? What is the timeframe of completing analysis to exporting data and figures to write a paper? Is there any data that cannot be used? 

  

I look forward to understanding more.

My rough estimate for the impact of this on the subset of variants I was looking at (autosomal SNVs) is that ~43,000 DNMs (e.g. chr5:175050953) should have failed the stringent filter but didn’t and that ~37,000 DNMs (e.g. chr1:965211) should have passed this filter but didn’t. Would you be able to confirm whether this might be the case? We emailed Loukas Moutsianas about this directly late on Friday but as I received an away from office message I thought I would also raise a ticket here.

Hi Pooja –

 

Thank you for getting in touch. Please accept my apologies for the delayed response as I was out of office for a family wedding.

 

I am providing some initial thoughts here and will need to reach out to GeL to clarify answers to others.

 

*<High Priority Concern: “Mismatched Tables”>*

Regarding the high priority concern, you are correct. The fusion prevalence and fusion partners tables are not immediately comparable due to subjects which have multiple fusions within a single sample or across multiple samples. In the fusion prevalence table, all observations are summarized so that a patient gets a call of NRG1 fusion positive if they have at least one fusion passing filters across all available data and contribute a single count to the table. This summary becomes somewhat less compact in the fusion partners table; now, each column has summarized data such that a patient gets a call of NRG1-[Partner] if they have at least one such fusion across all available data. However, they can appear in multiple columns if multiple distinct partners were observed. Thus, one must focus interpretation to individual columns.

 

At best, one can relate the tables by ensuring that the fusion partners table has no fewer than the number of Total Fusion Positive samples identified in the prevalence table. These two numbers will only be equal if all subjects have at most one fusion passing filters.

 

In addition, the code used for this analysis was QC’ed thoroughly and (while this does not rule out errors) would not be my first assumption should their be curious results.

 

*<Medium Priority comment: Fusion validity given all fusions are “novel?”>*

{color:#000000}I wouldn’t conclude that these fusions are invalid given that they are novel fusion partners. To my mind, this could occur for several reasons: 
 
 (1) The population studied by Jonna et al is not comparable to the GeL population.{color}

{color:#000000}(2) For rare fusions, external studies may not have sufficient depth to find all partners. 
 
 Of particular interest is (1). There may be certain inclusion criteria in GeL which limit the presence of samples with known genetic causes of disease. Thus, there may be an under-enrichment of the usual suspects. We will confirm what, if any, inclusion / exclusion criteria were applied in your indications of interest with GeL.{color}

 *{color:#000000}*<Additional Concerns requiring input from GeL>*{color}*
 # Is GeL willing / able to provide the parameters used for running MANTA to call structural variants?
 # Regarding Endocrine tumors, does GeL store information as to which of these cancers are thyroid cancers? If so, where is this data located?
 ## In the cancer analysis table, I cannot find standardized variables describing subtypes for Endocrine tumors outside of the “papillary”, “medullary”, etc. designations provided in the original tables.
 # Can GeL point us to the inclusion / exclusion criteria for cancer analysis participants?

 

Some of the questions above seem like ones we could answer with dedicated searching of the extensive GeL documentation, but I’d like to get an answer back to Merus quicker than that. [@Castello, Stephanie|mailto:scastello@uk.imshealth.com] – can you put us in touch with someone at GeL to answer the questions above?

 *Subject:* RE: Merus Report v0.1 and Results File

 

Hi team,

 

We have received some initial feedback from Merus (v1.1 attached here). [@Wilson, Douglas|mailto:Douglas.Wilson@q2labsolutions.com] / [@Zhang, Dadong|mailto:dadong.zhang@q2labsolutions.com], please do take a look at the comments, I think for most of these, you may be best placed to answer them as they are related to the bioinformatics part of it.

 

Of high priority is this comment around Objective 3 (Tabulation of NRG1 fusion partners):

 

“The tables in the xlsx file for this part either contain errors or I interpret these incorrectly:

When I count the fusion partners per indication, I get to higher Total Fusion Positive counts than listed in quite a few cases (for high-level indications: ADULT GLIOMA, BLADDER, BREAST, COLORECTAL, MALIGNANT MELANOMA, PROSTATE, RENAL, SARCOMA, UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL).

E.g. for ADULT GLIOMA there are 2 fusion partners (ADCY8, ADCY8), but the Total Fusion Positive count listed is 1. This means that either the Total Fusion Positive count is wrong, or there are cases with two different (samples and?) fusions, as described in 4.7. The numbers are sometimes very far off (e.g. for BREAST the listed Total Fusion Positive count is 46 but I count 58, for SARCOMA it is 18 but I count 29.

This is worrisome, as the Total Fusion Positive count is what was provided in the Phase 1 project (same as Table 1 below). If that is wrong, Merus has been working with wrong numbers all the time.”

 

I took a look at the results in the VFINAL results file, also attached, and barring any errors, my understanding was that one patient may have multiple fusions detected, so you could have 46 fusion (+) patients for breast cancer, but if they have multiple samples taken / possibility of detecting multiple fusion partners then number of fusion positive patients ≠ number of fusion partners. Does that sound reasonable / is that what is happening here?

 

Thank you!

 

Best,

Pooja

I have tagged you in a couple of comments, and awaiting feedback on version of GeL used for Phase 2 of the analysis (v9 vs v10).

 

I have added a comment in the report for this as well, but flagging via email too – not sure if it is required to include additional analysis on cancer distribution by stage (done by Svetomir) in the appendix. It doesn’t fit in with any of the objectives, and it is done on v12 of the GeL database, so doesn’t align with the version used for the analysis. I would recommend sharing this as a separate deliverable with Merus, but happy to add it in if the team disagrees.

 

Best,

Pooja

 *Subject:* RE: Merus Report v0.1 and Results File

 

Hi all –

 

I have taken a look at the report and see no issues. I did make a comment to clean up the presentation of the rule sets around fusion identification, but it is minor.

Regarding Pooja’s question below, I cannot speak to Merus’ purpose for identifying fusion partners. However, I can make some assumptions. Certain fusions can be considered “well-supported” as these are commonly observed fusions across cancers with noted oncogenic properties. For example, NTRK3-ETV6. It is likely that Merus is looking to identify how many of these “well-supported” fusions are present and see what novel fusion partners are also identified. This could help them see how representative the GeL population is of the population at large and to see how non-specific the rearrangements are when producing malignant neoplastic cell populations.

Hi all,

 

Please see attached Merus report v0.1 and the excel results file. A few things to note:

 
 * I don’t have access to the project SharePoint, so I suggest that [@Castello, Stephanie|mailto:scastello@uk.imshealth.com], if you could upload the report to the SP so that Ben and Val can comment on it, and once they have reviewed, I can take it back offline {color:#00b050}Done, my apologies I thought Margherita provided you access! I will ask IT to add you{color}
 * For the Tables, I have slightly  modified the TOC and added table numbers, so it’s easier to refer to in the report body {color:#00b050}– sounds good to me{color}
 * I have added sections for Phase 2, maintaining the Phase 1 report text. This is how I understood the updating of the document to work; do let me know if that was not the intention. {color:#00b050}Good for me as this was also my understanding{color}
 * Specifically regarding Objective 3 results (Tabulation of NRG1 fusion partners), I need help on this in terms of interpretation. I am lacking context on what exactly the client goal was for this objective. I have commented it out, so any feedback is welcome. {color:#00b050} I will review the report tomorrow but will let Ben and Valeria commenting on this. If needed we can ask Dadong and Douglas to help on this section.{color}

I would like to provide some feedback regarding the sample overlap between Genomics England and UK Biobank. For reference, this relates to tickets GEL-100918 and GEL-100918 where we were notified of ~1,300 overlapping individuals and were granted an attempt to remove sample overlap using PRS value comparison between UKB and GEL. 

Since we were granted re-identification, we were wondering if you could provide a mechanism after all to flag these individuals, as our attempt is proving more difficult than anticipated?

In general, we believe that this would be an important feature for all researchers using GEL data, in order to avoid accidental overfit and incorrect interpretation of results if UKB data were used in combination with GEL data.

A researcher sent me a document within rocket chat in the RE. This lists GEL IDs against a research number relating to potential diagnoses in a pending publication. It was agreed that as a courtesy, I would contact the recruiting clinicians for each of the GEL participants to ensure they had received the updated information about their participant and that they were notified of the pending paper. I had started mapping the recruiting clinicians and saved this document, within the RE, to my desktop. I subsequently had the white screen problem with the RE but thankfully this has resolved. However, now I cannot open excel within the RE to be able to access my document, nor the original document from the researcher within rocket chat. As a potential solution I tried to submit an airlock request to export the document and it said, ‘internal server error’. Currently, I cannot work on this and would be grateful if anyone can advise the best way to resolve it. I am not sure if the problem is with the document itself, excel within the RE, my permissions or something else!

Dear GE  
  
Can I ask a question with regards to a figure my supervisor was hoping to use in a presentation?  
  
We have a preliminary heatmap of the SNVs and CNVs in locally recruited 100k patients. We used only data available to the clinicians through the supplementary html files and this was the same data discussed in our local tumour board MDTs. None of the data was taken from the RE and no Gel IDs are visible on it.  
  
My supervisor would like to use it in an ESMO presentation to indicate the direction of research we are looking to go with the 100k data. We have plans to expand this formally in the RE using the national cohort and airlock etc and we have a project in the research registry approved for this.

I tried to run the Gene-Variant Workflow (https://research-help.genomicsengland.co.uk/display/GERE/Gene-Variant+Workflow) (just as a test first) but cannot make it work.

As it is explained in the gudelines I first copied the folder /gel_data_resources/workflows/BRS_tools_geneVariantWorkflow/v1.7/

May I ask you for some help with the type of a platekey, LP3000956-DNA_G02?  

  

In the genome_file_path_and_type spreadsheet, sometimes it is recorded as cancer germline but sometimes it is recorded as cancer somatic.

Hello,

Since the upgrade, git diff does not show any output. A quick google gives a workaround, but I suspect it’s something you want to fix globally. so that other users are not confused.

I have fixed it by setting the pager to less, with:

$ git config --global core.pager ‘less'

Research Enquiries,GEL-118945,155710,,Question about script to extract variants  ,28/Jul/21 2:53 PM,mvizueteforster,Other,"Hello
I am Miguel Barroso a GeCIP member of the Renal and Paediatrics domain. I am writing to ask you if your could help me to tell if an script I made it seems correct, any feedback will be much appreciated. 

I am using this script to extract variants from a list of VCF files. This script is called extract_variants_by_consequence_38.V4.sh (please see attached the screenshot of it: images 1 and 2). I made it based on another script called extract_variants_by_consequence which I was given by another GeCIP member (and I think it is very similar to the extract_variants_by_coordinate script available in the research environment). 

The main reason why I made this script is because I wanted to:
-	Select indels
-	Filter by DP (read depth), GQ (genotype quality) and GQX (PASS according to illumina)
-	Avoid selecting intronic variants

Given that I am not an expert in bioinformatics I would like to ask you if:
1.	Is there any extract_variants_by_consequence script already available in the research environment that extract frameshift ?
2.	If not, is the script I made the appropriate method to SNVs and indels variants? (the other method I assume is deleting the ‘MIN(FMT/DP)>10 & MIN(FMT/GQ)>20’ row (as it is specified in the extract_variants_by_coordinate script). However if I do that I don’t know how to filter by GQX, GQ and DP. I think that by filtering by DPI (the read depth score found in indels) I can also select the indels. Is this an accepted way of selecting indels?
3.	Is a GQ>15 filter more appropriate than a GQ>20 ?
4.	Not much related with the script, but I noticed that there are several genome.VCF files pathways corresponding the same patient, for instance the patient with id: 122003534 (please see attached image 3) has 3 different genome VCF files, is there any difference between them (and a similar case occurs in about than 200 participants I want to investigate).

Apologies if I should have sent this questions in a different way or if they are not well explained. Please let me know if I need to provide/explain something else.

Thanks a lot 
Best wishes

Incident,GEL-117533,154228,,Rstudio aborts when using ggplot,19/Jul/21 9:41 AM,parunachalam1,GeCIP User,"Hi,

My Rstudio keeps aborting the session when I want to make a plot using ggplot. Everything works fine until I actually run the lines to make the plot and then the session aborts immediately. I already tried logging out and back into the research environment and restarting a new Rstudio session but it keeps happening. I thought time might resolve it but it started happening on Friday and continues now. Could you have a look into what might be causing this?

Thank you very much for your help!

When I was using VEP in the Helix system, even though I have got enough memories for the jobs submitted (see picture 1), the job was terminated after few minutes. The reason for the termination was out of memory (see picture 2). The option I used for the VEP is in picture 3. The vcf I am annotating has only around 2000 variants. Could you please take a look and teach me how to fix this? Thank you very much.

Research Enquiries,GEL-116313,152990,,Cohort Coverage,12/Jul/21 1:17 PM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"Dear Genomics England team, 

A valuable resource for our team (and we imagine many others) that is not currently available in the environment is a file describing the mean coverage of all base pairs across the sequenced genomes. These types of summary files are available for many other large genome databases (e.g. gnomAD, https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#v3-coverage or /public_data_resources/gnomad/v3.1.1/coverage/ in RE). The major application is that it reveals where there was enough coverage across the genomes in the cohort for variants to be called, and where there was not. This provides a critical background correction for analyses such as variant enrichment/depletion in genes or other genomic regions.

The generation of these coverage statistics requires access to BAM files, which is why I currently cannot run it myself. A program often used to generate these statistics is mosdepth (https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) and as we’re experienced with running this, we’d be happy to provide specific code or run ourselves with access to the BAM files. Given that this is a summary statistic, it only needs to be run on a random subset of genomes to generate an accurate estimate for the cohort (i.e. 5-10% of genomes from GRCh37 and 5-10% of genomes from GRCh38). Please let me know this would be possible. 

Best,

I wondered whether there was filtering of patients included in the glioma_specific_dataset_pilot? Since not all the glioma patients are included, are these patients who entered the 100K project before a certain date cut off? 

Also, the molecular_mutations_in_path_report, are these from the GeCIP report? If so, are there ways of quickly finding out the domains for these variants, the cDNA and protein change, predicted consequences and population germline allele frequency, which are also included in the molecular report?

I am trying to run GATK's spark implementations with the HPC and i am having a lot of issues. Running the same test set with the same command will either complete fine or give me java error. Please see the below screen shot for the exact error.

I cannot figure out a work around for this and I do not know why it is happening. When I submit to the HPC i am requesting 8 CPUs to be run on ONE host with 24GB memory. 
The process runs completely fine until it is gathering the partitioned bam file. This error will occuring during FOUR different tasks(samSortSpark, markduplicates spark, base recalibration spark and apply recalibration spark)  which implement spark, but never consistently. So I can run samSortSpark fine one time, and mark duplicates spark will then fail. Then I rerun the SAME command and then samSortSpark will return the error. This is happening frequently enough that I cannot get any worthwhile data out. Can you guys guide me as to know to prevent the offsets not in order error from occuring? I am 100% certain this is an issue with the HPC not my individual tasks.

Dear Madam or Sir,

 

I am an MSc student of Human Molecular Genetics at ICL currently working on a Project Thesis - Investigating the genetics of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) using 100k genome data.

 

For analysing the SV (duplication) in the gene of interest in one proband I need to plot an allele specific coverage of the duplication in the R studio.

Service Request,GEL-106579,143054,,Query about Pulling data on a subset of samples in aggv2 cookbook,17/Jun/21 3:24 PM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User," 
Dear GEL team,

I wanted to pull the number of ""HC"" LoF variants per person in the aggv2. I found the last script at the bottom of this page: [https://research-help.genomicsengland.co.uk/display/GERE/aggV2+Code+Book%3A%3ACombining+Queries].

I just wanted to ask before running the script if the following is correct:
 - I have made the samples file simply a list of every platekey in the aggv2

 - I have changed the +split-vep part to read:

 
{code:java}
bcftools +{code}
{color:#333333}{color:#333333} {color}{color}

Does this look correct? I don't want to block up the GEL nodes with code that will fail at the last hurdle...

Service Request,GEL-106256,142624,,Questions about structural variant call data,15/Jun/21 10:12 PM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"Dear GESD,

Could you kindly help me with the following queries I have about the SV
 call data for individual samples in the research environment:

1) Most *.SV.vcf.gz files have the final column header = Sample ID (e.g.
 LP3000759-DNA_B03). However some *.SV.vcf.gz files have a completely
 different final column header for the same information (e.g.
 494B_B03_NA12881_PG_20180525_L4_1-4nM_Nano_DFL_auto_20_HX_Proband)
 despite having identical filename formatting. Why are these vcfs different?

2) The column header format described above (e.g.
 494B_B03_NA12881_PG_20180525_L4_1-4nM_Nano_DFL_auto_20_HX_Proband) is
 also used as the final column header in *.diploid.SV.vcf.gz files. What
 distinguishes the *.diploid.SV.vcf.gz files from the *.SV.vcf.gz files?

3) The following 6 sample IDs have empty directories under the
 ""/genomes/by_date/"" directory: LP3000323-DNA_D01, LP3000867-DNA_G05,
 LP3000892-DNA_C10, LP3000911-DNA_C07, LP3000911-DNA_D07, and
 LP3000911-DNA_H07). Are structural variant calls available for these
 samples?

I just wanted to check that I can continue communicating directly with the clinician from the clinical side as it is an internal request within our NHS Trust or if I need to go through the portal and wait for it to come back to me through the arranged channels.

Any advice greatly appreciated.

This is a repeat of the request from 3 similarly named previous tickets. I link all of the CCR tickets that need this variant checking below, organised by the user who made the CCR. I will assign this to Roel once created , as I believe this is now his responsibility within the BRS team.

+Marta Futema+ (note: for all of these ones, the ID is for a family member of the proband rather than the proband themselves, which is possibly why the variant is not on CVA)

Service Request,GEL-105152,141466,,question for GRCh38 reference assemblies. ,09/Jun/21 8:50 AM,mvizueteforster,GeCIP User,"Hi, 
While I was working with genomic data and trying to use reference genome of GRCh38 assembly. I found two fasta data within GEL. One is /public_data_resources/reference/GRCh38/GRCh38Decoy_no_alt.fa. The other is /public_data_resources/GATA/resources/broad/hg38/v0/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta. 
The two fasta data are different. If I would like to merge GRCh38 data between samples and liftover GRCh37 to GRCh38 vcfs, which reference genome should I use for GRCh38 assembly? At the same time, under /public_data_resources/GATA/ directory, there was no GRCh37 reference genome. For GRCh37 reference genome, should I use fasta file, /public_data_resources/reference/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.dna.primary_assmbly.fa, as GRCh37 reference genome?

Incident,GEL-104806,141103,,Procedure to remove GEL overlap with UK Biobank,07/Jun/21 12:38 PM,rbevers,Commercial User,"Hello,

we have previously been notified that there are ~1,300 individuals in GEL that are also UK Biobank participants. As it is our goal to validate our polygenic risk scores (PRS) that are trained in UKB in GEL, overlap may lead to better predictive performance due to overfit. Therefore, we are proposing a procedure to remove any potential overlap while ensuring participant anonymity. This has been discussed with our in-house legal team who believe it is an appropriate set of analyses which do not identify individuals, but we would like to consult GEL on our proposed analyses:

We propose the removal of individuals that are part of both UKB and GEL through correlation of PRS values, as outlined in the following steps:

1. Import de-identified PRS values for our 10 traits for all UKB individuals (“UKB PRS”) into the GEL environment (no UKB IDs will be imported to GEL).
2. For each individual in our GEL dataset, correlate the PRS values calculated in GEL for the 10 traits (“GEL PRS”) with the UKB PRS.
3. Where there is a high correlation between GEL PRS and UKB for a GEL individual, remove that GEL individual from analyses for our PRS validation work. 
4. Remove the imported UKB PRS from the GEL environment.
5. Ensure that no information regarding the removed GEL participants (e.g. participant ID) is transferred to Genomics. Participant IDs used for exclusion will be deleted from the GEL environment following completion of analyses.

Please let us know if the above is ok,
Saskia

(Genomics England bioinformatics review: Based on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/126456/ for this protein variant, we are searching for a deletion within the range of 44908792-44908794 for build 38. While mention is primarily made of TCC, the actual variant seems to be a deletion of a CTC pattern which is also mentioned once: NM_000041.2:c.499_501delCTC. In the platypus file this indeed seems annotated as followed: ""chr19 44908791 . GCTC G""
Participant 111001744 is not a proband. Participant 111001744 is heterozygote for the variant mentioned above.)|

|*Clinician contact info*|The identified variant has been recently published as associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). FH is a common monogenic disease that leads to high LDL cholesterol leveles and increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. We would like to report this variant as an incidental finding since high cholesterol levels can usually be managed by statins treatment. We are also interested in knowing the lipid profile of the mutation carriers since this has not been assessed in individuals outside of FH patients' cohorts.|

Dear Service Desk Team,

Currently my session freezes and I'm getting locked out constantly from the RE. I think the reason is that one user (lheskin or so...) is running massive parallel jobs on the login node. The user is running up to 16 jobs in parallel on the login node (please see the screenshots attached). Would it please be possible to let the user that he is blocking all other users from working in the RE by doing this.

Many thanks!

Thanks Freya,   
  

I now have access to the site.   
  

Do I do the IG training for external users or the other ones for Genomics England staff?

Dear Sam,    
 
  

     
 
  

I am deeply embarrassed to say that I have forgotten my password amongst a multitude of others.    
 
  

I tried to access the forgotten password with the captcha and username and failed.    
 
  

Is there any way of setting a new password please to complete the IG training?

The message was there for such a short time I didn't quite get a chance to read it. Then a few minutes later everything just shut down.
Now when I try to login in again, I have lost the Excel icon so cannot continue to look at the Excel sheet I had just generated.
What's up?"
Service Request,GEL-103744,139872,,Please create a test account for the cardiovascular GeCIP,27/May/21 11:29 AM,fminneci,Internal User,"Dear Service Desk,

Could we please have a test account enabled for the cardiovascular GeCIP in RE1 ?

This should look like other test accounts, for example like ""test22renal"", but it should give access to locations and files in the cardiovascular GeCIP space, rather than locations in the renal GeICIP as ""test22renal"" does.

In case one already exists for this GeCIP, can you please point me to it?  I looked for one but could not find it.

Thank you!

Incident,GEL-103742,139870,,saved work lost in R studio,27/May/21 11:17 AM,parunachalam1,Commercial User,"Hi ,

 

Yesterday (26th of May) I have worked the entire day on a file in R studio which I made sure I saved many times.

Today when I came back to it, all applications started yesterday were closed, I restarted R again and the file is reverted to the version from the day before and it is shown as saved today (I did not, I only open the file).

 

Can it be reverted to yesterday version that I have saved (26th of May)? If yes, please write to me and I will indicate which file it is, I will work on a copy meanwhile.

 

It has happened another time before and I would like to make sure I do not lose my work again like this. I am not new working in linux / on a HPC / Rstudio, I work in other environments and hadn’t have this happen. I think this is specific to Research Env and perhaps should be looked at,

 

Many thanks,

|File Name | |for_export.tar.gz | 
|File Description | |Three text files per cohort, one for hotspots, one for mutsigcv, and one for mutation count output. One additional file for a third method of gene scoring called bozer and lastly one file containing the number of participants in each cohort. Each file ending in .masked contains patient count data and has been masked so that no counts lower than 5 appear in the files. Each file ending in .cut has had all unnecessary columns removed from the file to export as little as possible, as per previous discussions and agreements. Of note is that not all files are present for the BREAST subtypes, since they were already exported in a previous submission. The mutation count files now contain copy number aberration counts in addition to SNV counts. Other than that, this export should be very similar to the two previous ones and is mostly a recalculation of the scoring based on different groupings of data. The file names might be a bit different but the content should be familiar. |

|Data Export Type | |variant | 
|Request Justification | |This is work done for the project between the ICR and GeL led by Bissan Al-Lazikani. It is very similar to the previous export (and contains data from the same participants). The key differences are; 1) CNV count data has been added to each cohort; 2) Many cohorts have been split into subtypes relevant to that cancer type, like the previous export of the breast cancer split that was exported a few weeks ago. The base data is exactly the same. |

{color:#000000} I've been receiving your message saying that there are problems with R, Rstudio and Rlibs for the past few days. I had been working on writing a script for an analysis. After I finished polishing it and it was working perfectly, the next time I logged in to GEL RE I got a message from Rstudio saying that this file no longer existed because it had been deleted, do I want to save a copy. So I say yes and I save a backup copy just in case because I don't know what happened. However, the copy that the system allowed me to save is NOT the final working version of my script. Can you explain why this has happened? How is it possible that I have a perfectly working file in the GEL RE one day, and on the next day it tells me that the file is gone and has been deleted, which I myself have obviously not deleted? I'm extremely unhappy with the service provided by the GEL RE.{color}

 I wonder if this is the right place to submit my query, but I just wanted to clarify what the Genomics England's Rare Disease Eligibility Criteria document means when it says for each disease, under ""<Disease name> exclusion criteria"": 
 
 ""Prior genetic testing guidance - 
 Results should have been reviewed for all genetic tests undertaken, including disease-relevant genes in exome sequencing data. *The patient is not eligible if they have a molecular diagnosis for their condition.* 
 ... 
 prior genetic testing genes 
 Testing of the following genes should be carried out PRIOR TO RECRUITMENT where this is in line with current local practice:  
 <list of genes>"" 
 
 
 Does this mean that participants with a positive genetic test for the disease are not included as a rare disease participant within the rare disease cohort, and why is this?

I'm working on the sarcoma domain and I've noticed that 6 cases were included in the V11 release (both in the standard LabKey table and in the genome_file_paths_and_types because you're only working on the realigned cases) and these cases aren't part of the V12 release.

It seems like 4 of those aren't present in the V12 LabKey any longer and 2 are present in the V12LabKey table but don't have realigned data (genome_file_paths_and_types V12), which is confusing because there was realigned data in V11 for those.

I did as described in the Research Environment Documentation - copied the workflow to my folder, edited the gene_list.txt file to add the gene names and added the the project code to both submit_workflow.sh and variant_workflow_inputs.json files. However, it runs for a bit and then stops - giving me the message ""Workflow transitioned to state Failed"" in the .stderr file. I'm running the workflow from the workflow folder (v1.7). I get 3 output folders in the v1.7 directory - cromwell-executions, cromwell-workflow-logs, final_output. In the final_output directory I get only two folders - call_logs and workflow_logs.

Service Request,GEL-101756,137218,,Obtaining ACMG criteria for solved cases,17/May/21 4:22 PM,rbevers,GeCIP User," 

Dear GEL team,

 

I was wondering if one was able to access the final reports of those patients who have a “solved” GMC exit questionnaire from the rare disease cohort. Our group is writing up the “unexplained end stage renal failure in the young” cohort and wanted to create a table with the final ACMG classifications for the pathogenic mutations identified as per the attached table below. One can manually do this but I assume a score has been assigned as part of the MDT, would it be possible to access these?

 

Many thanks for your time and I look forward to your response.

 

All the best

Hello,
  

Please, I would like to ask for help logging in the RE.
  

All of my work is in Genomics England and I couldn't work at all last week.
  

I mostly use the terminal (and the HPC cluster) and Rstudio, but last week I couldn't use Rstudio at all, and from Friday I couldn't start a terminal screen.
  

I can't even log out of the RE to start a new session. It can be a problem with the language, possibly last time I logged in the browser changed the language automatically. I noticed some of the icons in the home screen are in my language (Portuguese). Now I can't open a terminal and can't log out to restart the session.
  

I opened a ticket one week ago, about the R issues and I still can't use it.
  

I need to use tidyverse and survminer packages and I don't know in which version of R they are installed. I tried all of them, and Rstudio doesn't find the libraries. Where is the library directory and how do I set Rstudio to find it?
  

Thanks for your attention

Incident,GEL-101670,137101,,Issues with step 1 of SAIGE GWAS,17/May/21 10:59 AM,rbevers,GeCIP User," 

Dear  GEL team,

 

I have run the SAIGE GWAS pipeline on one cohort successfully but on a subset (i.e. a smaller phenofile) I get the error listed in the screenshot below. I’m not sure what to do as the phenofile is smaller than previously so it is odd that the JSON file is “too large”. Have you encountered this error before as part of your pipeline creation? I have tried increasing the memory when running it as a batch but it still errors out…. I have run it interactively below to highlight the error.

 

Many thanks

I just ran into an issue for family_id 111000006 in the LabKey ""participant"" table.

The registration dates for the participants are 2015-08-02. And the date of consent 2015-08-03. Usually for most participants the consent date is one day after registration. However, for one member of this family it's 2015-03-08. I believe month/day should be reversed. See screenshot.

This is a single occurrence so far. Not sure if this happens more, but I wanted to log the issue. I'd consider it a low priority at least.

Service Request,GEL-101471,136782,,potentially premature released ESCALATE participants present in Data Release v12,14/May/21 11:10 AM,mscheepmaker,Internal User,"Hiya,

I have recently been made aware of the incoming ESCALATE cohort into the Research Environment by [~ANeed], [~atuff-lacey], [~pgoddard], [~LButtigieg] (Tagging for awareness, not necessarily needed to be involved for this specific ticket).

*Summary*

We detected 17 members of the Escalate Cohort present in the participant table in Data Release 12. These participants stood out due to their year_of_birth being 1900. 

Another odd observation is the ""Registered at Ldp Ods Code"" being ""source-organisation0"" with bioinformatics Ods Code ""sou"". Handling Gmc code is EOC for ESCALATE Oesophageal Cancer.

These participants are also present in the plated_sample table. Multiple platekeys but I assume that this is due to the ""double-depth"", and then an additional platekey for the merged data. No genomic or clinical data is present yet as far as we can see.

*Question*

Should these participants have been released in the Data Release already?

*Participants list*
{code:java}
   participant_id
            <int>
 1      233000117
 2      233000124
 3      233000126
 4      233000133
 5      233000141
 6      233000145
 7      233000147
 8      233000150
 9      233000162
10      233000168
11      233000170
12      233000172
13      233000176
14      233000178
15      233000181
16      233000182
17      233000186
{code}
 

Would be great if we can get some clarity on this, and whether it's ok to leave them in the Data Release for now. 

Maybe [~sthompson], [~jpullinger] knows more about this? Or at least would be able to trace it to its source better :) 

Many thanks in advance!

Service Request,GEL-101306,136564,,Patients journeys in GEL,12/May/21 5:48 PM,mvizueteforster,Commercial User," 

Hello,

 

I am trying to better understand the patient journeys. A few questions:

 

1) hes_apc table. I am trying to see other information as the Normalised specific disease. For example , I select all diags (1-20) from the hes_apc table for a given patient. I can get for example this: 

 

!image002.jpg|thumbnail!

 

So why exactly more than 1 lines for the same participant are available? What does a line represent compared to a different line ? ICD9 in line 1? ICD10 in the next 2 lines? How are these Dx selected and  added in there? This particular patient is in for Dilated Cardiomyopathy but no such Dx among the ICD codes...this participant got diagnosed in 2017: are recent ICD codes not reflected in the hes_apc table? How are the 20 Dx there selected? I see 467 columns to the hes_apc table, is there any spec to them ?

 

2) What does the normalised specific disease mean for a relative? That the relative has the disease themselves?

 

Thank you in advance,

 

 

With Regards,

 

Ana

Service Request,GEL-100568,135706,,CADD software changes for use within RE1,05/May/21 4:02 PM,mvizueteforster,Internal User,"This ticket is linked to GEL-100441

The software is unable to run as the tool attempts to create a custom conda env on the fly. This is not possible for two reasons:
 # the install location is not writeable by the software user
 # the software is prevented from reaching out to the web to pull the required packages

I have requested a custom environment be created to overcome these issues but the CADD script will need to be edited to use the new environment instead of creating the new environment GEL-100564

Software Request,GEL-100564,135702,,INSTALL (Python): Custom Conda Environment Creation Request,05/May/21 3:53 PM,parunachalam1,Other,"Dear [~parunachalam1],

I hope that this message finds you safe and well. The customer in this ticket has come up against a number of issues with the use of the CADD v1.6 tool. I have tried to take the troubleshooting further but have . Please review the following steps below 

Error reported by the customer has been reproduced, the error indicates that snakemake is not generally available within Helix

I attempted to load the snakemake module (snakemake/5.7.1-foss-2019a-Python-3.7.2 ) and run script
-> failed with ""CreateCondaEnvironmentException:""

I discovered a snakemake minimal within conda environment idpcorepy3tf2rev1
-> [Errno 13]  Permission denied.
It appears that the tool is trying to make a new conda file within the comon envs dir. Write permission is denied, which makes sense given the install location. The process is designed to ensure the correct environment is set but as the RE1 will not allow calls to external conda channels this process will inevitably fail even if write permission is provided. 

I would like to propose creating a static version of the required conda environment (cadd_env) and seeing if we can coerce the tool into using this static environment. Details of the environment and the links to the installation YAML file is listed below. Once created please let me know as I will need to test possible changes to the CADD scripts to leverage this environment."

Dear all

 

Please see a few actions for the Genomics England dataset:

 

*BMS Initial Users for Data Acce*

 

Here are the first few BMS names that we would like to gain initial access to the dataset with the view that we may swap in and out over time if needed depending on projects.

Belmonte, Christopher [Christopher.Belmonte@bms.com|mailto:Christopher.Belmonte@bms.com]

 

We very much appreciate that Genomics England are able to accommodate a few extras and it is unlikely that they will all be in the system at the same time. It just saves swapping names too often.

 

*Technical training*

 ** 

Kate has suggested that we have a couple of technical training sessions. One more focused on rare disease and one on cancer. Please do let Jane, Kate and I know who would fall in to each category. I will ask Jane to follow up with Kate and team to find time in the diary for this (pm UK time).   Please also let us know any additional BMS names would would like to be invited for potential future use of the dataset.

 

*Formulate research questions*

 

Once users had the ability to interrogate the data –specific research plans need to be put in place. The +template document+ is attached that will need to be filled out by relevant BMS teams once specific research areas are decided. Approvals usually take roughly a week once submitted

 

*Focused workshops to better understand data Genomics England hold for relevant stakeholders*

 

Once research areas are identified, I will work with Kate to arrange.

 

*Work on access to the cloud environment*

 

An amendment to our existing agreement is required to access the new data environment.  This is currently being reviewed by BMS.

 

Best wishes

Since BRS have moved to work on /pgen_int_work/BRS after originally working on /re_gecip/BRS/, we find ourselves in the position of requiring data that is stored on pgen_int_work while that is not accessible via the Research Environment.

Would it be possible to have /pgen_int_work/ mounted on the RE? Otherwise this may lead in unnecessary duplication of data. Ideally this is only allowed for internal users only, or just the BRS members. Not sure what's the best option here, so feel free to advise.

I hoping you might be able to provide some guidance.

When using the de novo variant dataset, I have come across numerous instances of nested trio VCFs that contain individuals (that have been assigned plate_key IDs and have therefore sequenced?) for which there is no records anywhere for those plate_key's in any of the Labkey tables. 

Can I assume that these participants have been removed from use and shouldn't be used rather than a technical error in filling out the Labkey tables?

I would be happy to provide examples but I wasn't sure if providing participant IDs here would be a breach of the rules.

I need to link two datasets – “rare_disease_analysis” and apc (from Secondary Data-NHSD) from the” Main-programme_v11” using participant id.

 

To do this, I assume I need to install R packages. I followed the following steps to install R packages from CRAN.

 

If we need to make a folder, do I type in the word “yourDomain”, or are you asking me to use my domain. But I’m not sure what’s my domain? I’m not a R user and this is new to me.

The aim of this ticket is to create a special role in the RE for reviewers of papers that our researchers are submitting, such that those reviewers can see only the data relevant to the paper. This will allow us to cover the case where a researcher needs to show a paper reviewer data that is too sensitive/identifying to come out of Airlock. According to Anna Need, we have an archived area for published data in the RE already, so what we need is a special login that would allow the user to access only this area.

I was wondering is there a problem with the internal CRAN mirror hosted under [https://artifactory.gel.zone/artifactory/cran] ?

When we are trying to install a package most of the time there is a discrepancy between the version that R is trying to install and the ones that are actually present in the mirror. This mismatch lead to us having to install packets manually by pointing to the specific tar.gz file in the artifactory.

This is happening with all R modules.

This appears to happen when I am working with the data when the program attempts to autosave. I am able to work with my data for 10-15 minutes before the autosave kicks in. It then causes a prolonged period of freezing, does not complete the autosave and prevents me from continuing to work with the data.   I have managed to copy the error message (see screenshot - cropped to avoid containing sensitive information) from within the RE that corresponds to the processing error in libre office calc.

Service Request,GEL-97305,131884,,installing a python package and dependencies,08/Apr/21 5:58 PM,parunachalam1,GeCIP User,"Dear GEL software/research team,

I am emailing to ask for your help!

I am the lead analyst on project RR315, analysing MPN genomes within the cancer_haem gecip. We have been working closely with Alona Sosinsky as our genomes suffer from tumour in normal contamination and Pipeline 2.0 has struggled to recover some variants that we know to be present. As part of this I am hoping to run deTiN, a Broad algorithm to quantify TINC and recover TINC variants from the germline calls. I applied some time ago for deTin to be imported (it has been approved but is yet to be installed).

In the meantime, I want to generate the required inputs for deTin, which are Mutect VCF files. Mutect is pretty compute intense - I have tried running it natively in helix, and it tends to crash after about 72 hours on the 3rd chromosome! My computational oncology lab have developed a highly parallelised pipeline implementation of mutect, which runs over a whole genome in ~7 hours. It requires a python package (developed in house) and a singularity image. I note singularity is installed in helix.

Now:  this morning I requested (via the airlock) for the python scripts and singularity image to be imported into the GEL RE, which worked seamlessly and I have them installed in my /re_gecip/cancer_haem/CB/scripts/toil_mutect folder.

Of course, I have latterly realised that there is no way for me to compile the package/install the dependencies – belated realisation!

So here is where I need your help. There are 2 potential options

1)	Usually I would just run pip install . in my folder and the package should compile - If your team have internet access within the GEL RE, is it possible for your team to do so for me?

2) If not, is it possible for your team to generate a virtual environment (ideally a conda environment) that has the dependencies installed, that I could then access & activate to allow me to compile the package? The dependencies are as follows, and the pipeline works with python-2.7.x so these would need to be installed using python 2.7

We had submitted a long job to process chr19 and un-mapped human reads for 10,000 genomes on 4pm 4th March. It has a long wall time as it is only the lightweight master/controller job. The actual processing occurs in jobs sent to the short and medium queues as appropriate. The long job had completed about a quarter of the genomes and on checking this long job has suddenly just disappeared from the 1st of April. [hopefully not an April fool's joke].

Also, I noticed that there are about 28,000 jobs in the long queue and most hosts are closed.

I'd most grateful if you could let me know what's happened to our job and how/when to resume it. It is not even displaying in the list (bqueues).

We need a new python3 module in the python modules folder on the HPC cluster (Pegasus), which we would like to be named *3.7.0_gel_logistics*. We will be using this to support the production service - there are a number of python scripts that we run regularly for monitoring and reporting of the service, withdrawals, and other bits.

We want to be able to load this environment with the following command:
{code:java}
module load python/3.7.0_gel_logistics
{code}
Next, we need the pip version in that python module to be 21.0. That's the version that we do the testing with and also the one that should cause no issues in installation of all the requirements.
{code:java}
pip install pip==21.0{code}
Next, we would like for our package and its requirements to be installed in that environment. The package has been published on GEL's internal pypi and contains all its requirements in the setup file:

In May 2021 Astellas, a commercial Discovery Forum customer, will commence a research project. They want to be able to share outputs from their research work with selected third party researchers. They do not want to have to take the output files out of RE V1.0 via the airlock (MFT). They do not want the third parties to have to be part of their DF group with Astellas email addresses. They simply want to be able to provide read only access to some output data files so that informed third parties can take a look and potentially make some recommendations to enhance the work without changing anything.

 

“{color:#1f3864}This time we would like our collaborators, clinical geneticists and population/human geneticists , to review the results we obtained from GeL data in the Research Environment for deeper discussion with them with actual data. We expect to receive suggestions from them as professionals, especially how they pin down causal variants by fully using GeL data. I’d be happy that you could agree that it satisfies the above condition, i.e., access the environment as a part of the Astellas work.”{color}

I assume that these parties will need to go through a process to be provided with access to RE V1.0 – perhaps a separate research group would need to be created if they do not already have access via existing GeCIP or DF memberships.

Upon connection to the Research Environment an hour ago, we noticed that our data was missing. Specifically, anything in the downloads folder and a folder by the name ""PROJECT"" within our home directory is now missing. 

We are sure that we DID NOT erase those files. Everything inside ""helix"" is still there in our folder within our gecip domain. But what we had stored in the directory home outside of the HPC (mainly tables downloaded from Labkey and a .docx file with result tables) is missing. 

We checked for the files mainly because the ""ssh helix"" alias that we had created was not working, and we noticed that the "".ssh"" folder with its contents generated during the creation of the alias was missing. So we checked and ALL our data outside of the cluster is gone. Please tell us if you have any insight on what has happened. 

It looks as if our user had been erased and we were connecting for the first time, the programs are giving us ""welcome"" guides as if it was the first time we used them and all the data is gone.

Over the last couple of weeks, the quality of the Research Environment (RE) has reduced substantially. I've had frequent disconnections with loss of session, and there have been times when I've been unable to login to the RE at all. When I have been able to use the RE, it has been much slower than usual, with tasks such as opening PDFs taking minutes rather than seconds, and the File Manager being essentially unusable. 

For example, in the attached screenshot (which represents the state of my session at the moment) you can see there are a number of issues. The File Manager (on the right) is not displaying properly and is greyed out, meaning it is unusable. The bar at the bottom of the screen has also stopped working and turned black. 

What is the reason for the even-worse-than-usual state of the RE? Is it going to improve in the near future? It is currently very difficult to conduct research in the RE in its current state. I know others are also suffering with the same issues.

Hi,

I'm having usability/performance issues in the research environment. I
 emailed a couple of weeks ago because the update seemed to have wiped my
 execute permissions. For much of last week, Atom was freezing when asked
 to open quite small text files. This morning I couldn't open new files
 in Atom or scite (too many open on the system) so I tried logging out
 and back in again; now, I'm lucky if the terminal emulator will launch
 (it was initially failing with error message: Failed to execute default
 Terminal Emulator. Input/output error.).

Can anything be done? Between this and the latency it's getting harder
 and harder to be productive on the system.

Is it possible to reset my research environment settings or something? I have been having trouble with it for the last 2 weeks. I have lost all my desktop icons, which means I can't navigate to the home folder. I then lost my applications menu. Today, there is still no desktop and the applications menu is just full of box icons and no words (screenshot below). When I try to load Firefox from the applications icon, I get a blank error message (screenshot below). Therefore, it is extremely difficult to do any work inside the research environment right now, which is currently my full time PhD activity. 

I was in touch with Jeevan last week about this, who said he would refer it to the engineers, but things have now got worse and it is stopping me from doing my job.

I tested my Inuvika home directory and this is also the case.

Permissions are still OK/editable on the mounted volumes such as ~/discovery_forum/df_novartis/

Can you please fix this Inuvika VM file permissions issue.

We noticed that something strange is happening today, maybe as a result of the maintenance performed yesterday to inuvika research environment. The general appearance of the virtual desktop is changed, with the menu bar appearing in all black (see screenshot) without the ability to shut down/restart the machine as the option is no longer visible in the said menu bar. We've tried reloading the page and also rebooting the computer and in different browsers, but the appearance is the same in all cases. 

Also, the settings of the terminal emulator profile were lost during the maintenance process 

Any information on what is happening and if it/when is going to be solved?

Service Request,GEL-91367,125407,,Explain PAINTOR installation in the RE1.0,02/Mar/21 7:33 PM,parunachalam1,Internal User,"Dear SD,

This ticket is ideally for [~parunachalam1] in the RE1.0 squad, or anyway for engineers in the RE1.0 squad.

Dear Prabhu/RE1.0 squad,

Thank you for installing PAINTOR and its auxiliary scripts in the RE1.0 via GEL-84977.

The PAINTOR executable now works well as part of module bio/PAINTOR/v3.0 .

However, we are struggling to understand how to run the auxiliary scripts, for example the one called CANVIS.py that you mentioned in GEL-84977 (one of the last comments there).

That comment says that some dependent Python packages, needed to run the auxiliary scripts like CANVIS.py, were installed as part of the process - can I ask you where (in what env) those packages were installed please, and how to activate them in order to run CANVIS.py?

Many thanks,

Dear Anna 

I have been looking in the CVA as I have been trying to work out how many patients in the 100,000 Genomes Project have PURA syndrome, as I have a specialist interest in this condition and work closely with the PURA Syndrome Foundation ([https://www.purasyndrome.org/|https://www.purasyndrome.org/]). 

  

Please can you put me in contact with the referring clinicians for these patients, who all have (likely) pathogenic variants in PURA:

{color:#212121} *CAUTION:* This email originated from outside the organisation. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.{color} | 
 
  

Hello, 

  

I’m writing you because we have problems to install the ggdendro R package in the GeCIP environment. More specifically, we are running a pipeline that includes several scripts, and one of them is an Rscript that requires the ggdendro package. This pipeline was made almost 1 year ago and it was working, so we assume that some update in R has been done and that we would need to re-install the package -though we are using the same R3.6.2 version that was specified when it was working. However, when we try to install it locally, we get the following warning: 

  

!image001.png|thumbnail! 

  

And then, when we try to use the personal library, R redirects us to a CRAN mirror, which also doesn’t work (I tried several different mirrors and I couldn’t establish a connection with anyone).  

  

So, we are not sure about what we should do now to solve this issue. We are thinking that since this pipeline has to be used by different people, the best thing could be that the ggdendro package was installed in the general R library, but this is something that we can’t do. In addition, installing it locally could require to change several paths in several scripts, which we would like to avoid. Could it be possible that you help us on this? 

  

Thank you very much. 

  

Best wishes, 

Laia

I have been trying to run Mutect2 on multiple bam files through the HPC. I have gotten to the point where the job is running, I see the stdout for the shards are looking normal and everything is running as it should. At least it looks that way for the 3 or 4 jobs I check out of my 500. I then leave the windows open and leave the RE, expecting my terminals to still remain. When I returned this morning, the jobs have all failed and the windows I left open are closed. This has happened twice already. When I look at the stderr/stdout for the jobs, they all say:
Jobs are being terminated ""by user/owner."" 

I know I didnt terminate them. Now I have a few questions: 
1) Why are my windows being closed overnight? Could this have caused the 'user termination'? 
2) Is GEL manually killing my jobs? How do I prevent them from doing that? Why are you killing them? 

Honestly, I could use some guidance here as to how to prevent the jobs from killing itself (or saying I killed them) "

Service Request,GEL-84602,116687,,Update of R packages on helix,04/Jan/21 12:23 PM,mstrong,Internal User,"Hi, 

On Helix, please could you update the following for 4.x R modules to the versions stated:
dplyr - 1.0.2
tibble - 3.0.4
tidyselect - 1.1.0
magrittr - 2.0.1

Currently the latest version of tidyverse (1.3.0) is installed, but as the dependencies are not also updated, some functionality that should be expected in tidyverse isn't there.

I'm pretty sure these are all latest versions, so should be the default found in the cran mirror 

FAO: [~fminneci][~rbevers][~codhams][~astuckey][~mbpereira][~akousathanas] - if there are any packages you guys think should be added to this list, please comment.

Cheers"
